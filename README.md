      Driver for the Roboteq MDC22XX motor controller.
      Based on a pre-2/26/2012 version of Auburn University's Autonomous Lawnmower project (originally by William Woodall)'s AX2550 driver, merged with a similarly old version of his MDC2250 driver, as well as some very up to date (half backwards compatible) dependancies from PARTS UNKNOWN/UNDOCUMENTED (aka his github account. thx for neglecting to link the dependencies anywhere on the projects that use them, Bill).
